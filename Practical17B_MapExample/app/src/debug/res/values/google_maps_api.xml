    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    FE:83:2C:FF:CF:87:18:44:B8:D7:CF:97:3B:5C:87:19:F3:CB:3F:2F

    SHA-1 certificate fingerprint:
    FE:83:2C:FF:CF:87:18:44:B8:D7:CF:97:3B:5C:87:19:F3:CB:3F:2F

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
